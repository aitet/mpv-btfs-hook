* About
This plugin allows mpv to stream magnet links (and any other torrent identifier [[https://github.com/johang/btfs][btfs]] handles) directly. It will automatically remove videos after they are finished playing.

This script will detect =magnet:= links and torrent files/urls ending in =torrent= passed to mpv by default.

One reason you might want to use this script over calling the included ~btplay -p mpv~ is that you can start mpv with a playlist of multiple magnet links or add magnet links to the playlist of an already open mpv window (e.g. using one of the scripts that allow appending a link from the clipboard to the playlist).

* Requirements
- [[https://github.com/johang/btfs][btfs]]
- fuse ("fuse" in Ubuntu 16.04)
- libtorrent ("libtorrent-rasterbar8" in Ubuntu 16.04)
- libcurl ("libcurl3" in Ubuntu 16.04)

* Advantages Over Peerflix and Webtorrent
Peerflix and Webtorrent are both written in javascript and have to be installed using npm or external repos.
Btfs on the other hand is in both the default debian and default arch repos. Makes setup a lot easier and quicker. Btfs is also a lot simpler and cleaner implementation of a bittorrent filesystem protocol utilizing the FUSE subsystem.

Btfs makes the lua script a lot simpler in implementation than the Peerflix and Webtorrent of the past.
